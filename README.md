<!-- Functional Component  -->

Functional components are just a javaScript function which returns a react element or a JSX. 

If a Component inside a component then this is called component composition.




Two types of Export/Import

 export default Component;
 import Component from "path";


  - Named Export/Import
  export const Component;
  import {Component} from "path";
